# LDE - Lark Desktop Environment (Web-Based OS)

### **About LDE**
LDE is a web-based operating system inspired by the look and feel of a traditional desktop environment. The project brings together features like a desktop window manager, start menu, taskbar, and prebuilt applications, all accessible through a browser. With the goal of creating a fully interactive desktop experience, LDE combines the power of web development with the familiarity of a classic OS interface.

### **Why We Built LDE**
LDE began in **July 2021** as an entry for the **PPTOS competition** (PowerPoint OS competition), the team consists of six developers who worked collaboratively to build this operating system. Although the competition and community were later discontinued, the significant progress we made inspired us to continue development independently. 

Between **July 2021 and August 2023**, LDE evolved from a PPT-based OS into a **web-based OS** due to the inactivity of the original community. The project is now solely maintained and actively developed by me, focusing on porting all the features from PPTOS into the current web-based platform.
